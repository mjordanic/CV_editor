# Agent Model Configuration
# This file defines which OpenAI model each agent should use.
# Models are chosen based on task complexity and criticality while optimizing for cost.

  # CRITICAL AGENTS - Use GPT-5 mini for best quality/cost balance
  # These agents are the core of the CV/Cover Letter generation
  
  cv_writer:
    model: "openai:gpt-5-mini"
    temperature: 0.2
    filter_model: "openai:gpt-5-nano"
    filter_temperature: 0.0
    description: "Generates tailored CVs - critical for quality output"
    rationale: "CV writing requires creativity, precision, and quality. GPT-5 mini offers superior performance at $0.25/1M input tokens - better than GPT-4o-mini quality at similar cost. Uses gpt-5-nano for filtering operations (80% cost savings)."
  
  cover_letter_writer:
    model: "openai:gpt-5-mini"
    temperature: 0.2
    filter_model: "openai:gpt-5-nano"
    filter_temperature: 0.0
    description: "Generates tailored cover letters - critical for quality output"
    rationale: "Cover letter writing requires persuasive language and personalization. GPT-5 mini delivers excellent quality for well-defined creative tasks. Uses gpt-5-nano for filtering operations (80% cost savings)."
  
  critique:
    model: "openai:gpt-5-mini"
    temperature: 0.3
    quality_threshold: 85
    description: "Evaluates document quality and provides improvement instructions"
    rationale: "Quality assessment is critical. GPT-5 mini provides nuanced understanding of professional standards at reasonable cost."
  
  # MODERATELY CRITICAL AGENTS - Use GPT-5 nano for ultra-low cost
  
  router:
    model: "openai:gpt-5-nano"
    temperature: 0.0
    description: "Routes user requests and collects feedback"
    rationale: "Routing requires understanding context and classification. GPT-5 nano at $0.05/1M input tokens is perfect for this - 83% cheaper than GPT-3.5-turbo with better performance."
  
  job_description:
    model: "openai:gpt-5-nano"
    temperature: 0.0
    description: "Extracts structured information from job descriptions"
    rationale: "Information extraction is ideal for GPT-5 nano. Designed specifically for classification and extraction tasks at minimal cost."
  
  search:
    model: "openai:gpt-5-nano"
    temperature: 0.0
    description: "Summarizes search results into company descriptions"
    rationale: "Summarization is a core strength of GPT-5 nano. Ultra-cost-efficient at $0.05/1M input, $0.40/1M output tokens."
  
  # SIMPLE AGENTS - These don't use LLMs or use minimal LLM functionality
  
  document_reader:
    model: null
    temperature: null
    description: "Reads PDF and text files - no LLM required"
    rationale: "Pure file I/O operation, no AI needed."
  
  user_input:
    model: null
    temperature: null
    description: "Collects user input via interrupts - no LLM required"
    rationale: "Simple user interaction handling, no AI needed."
